Requirements for Highway Inspection and Maintenance using YOLOv8s-Seg in Google Colab


1. Environment Setup
Ensure that the necessary libraries are installed before running your pipeline.

--> pip install ultralytics pycocotools onnx opencv-python matplotlib pandas tqdm torch torchvision albumentations seaborn


2. Hardware Requirements

--> Google Colab with GPU (T4, V100, A100 preferred)
Storage: Google Drive integration for dataset and model storage



3. Data Processing Requirements

Data Collection: Image dataset from Google

Annotation: COCO JSON format (using Digital Sreeni)

Augmentation: Digital Sreeni for data enhancement

Dataset Splitting: Train, Test, Val(Dugital sreeni)



4. Conversion Requirements

--> COCO to YOLOv8 Conversion
--> Ensure segmentation masks are properly normalized (between 0-1)
--> Output label files in YOLO format



5. Model Training Requirements


--> Pre-trained Model: yolov8s-seg.pt

Hyperparameters:
epochs: 15
imgsz: 640
batch: 6
lr0: 0.001
optimizer: AdamW
patience: 5
device: 0 (GPU enabled)



6. Validation Requirements

Performance Metrics:
mAP@0.5
mAP@0.5:0.95


7. Testing Requirements


Inference on Test Images
conf: 0.25 (confidence threshold)
iou: 0.45 (intersection over union threshold)



8. Model Export Requirements



ONNX Export:
model.export(format="onnx", dynamic=True, simplify=True)
Alternative: Export as TorchScript, CoreML, etc.



9. Monitoring & Evaluation
--> Train vs. Validation Loss (to check underfitting/overfitting)
--> mAP Curves
--> Prediction Accuracy Analysis

10. Deployment 

Streamlit application:

1. Python Version
Python 3.8 or later (recommended)
2. Required Libraries
need to install the following Python packages:
pip install streamlit ultralytics opencv-python numpy


3. Model Files

YOLOv8 Model Weights: Ensure that the best.pt file is available at the specified path.



4. Hardware Requirements
CPU: Minimum dual-core processor
GPU (Optional but Recommended): NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support for faster inference
RAM: At least 4GB (8GB+ recommended for smooth operation)
5. Running the App

Save your script as app.py and run it using:
streamlit run app.py
